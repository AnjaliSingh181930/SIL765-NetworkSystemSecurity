We can glean about the security protocols utilized in the IITD MHS (Mail Handling System):

**Security Protocols:**

* **TLSv1.3:** This is a secure transport layer protocol used to encrypt the email content during transmission between mail servers. It's a good sign and helps protect against eavesdropping attempts.
* **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail):** This is an email authentication protocol that helps verify the sender's domain. It can help prevent email spoofing to some extent.

**Effectiveness against Attacks:**

* **TLSv1.3:** While TLSv1.3 is a robust protocol, it's not foolproof. Theoretically, a Man-in-the-Middle attack with sufficient resources could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in the implementation. However, such attacks are complex and less likely for internal email communication within a trusted network like IITD.
* **DKIM:** DKIM can prevent basic email spoofing attempts where someone sends an email pretending to be from another address. However, it has limitations:
    * It doesn't verify the sender's identity, only the domain. A malicious user with access to an authorized account within the domain (e.g., compromised IITD account) could still send emails with a valid DKIM signature.
    * DKIM relies on the receiving mail server to check the DKIM signatures, and some less secure mail servers might not implement this check.

**Missing Protocols:**

* **SPF (Sender Policy Framework):**  This protocol complements DKIM by specifying authorized mail servers for a domain. It can help further prevent spoofing attacks.
* **DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance):** This builds on SPF and DKIM and allows domain owners to instruct receiving mail servers on how to handle unauthenticated emails. It can be a valuable tool for identifying and mitigating email spoofing attempts.

**Overall Security:**

The use of TLSv1.3 and DKIM provides a baseline level of security for IITD emails. However, for enhanced protection against sophisticated attacks, implementing SPF and DMARC would be recommended.
